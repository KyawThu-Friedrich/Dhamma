# Dhamma
Dhamma is universal law of nature, rediscovered by the enlightened one and spread around the world for the benefit of all.
There are fundamentally three things in Dhamma which is Sila (Morality), Samadhi (Concentration), and Panna (Wisdom).
Everyone should practice Vipassana to purify the mind and free from miseries.
